# Kilosort python port

**Does not currently work**

This is a first attempt at porting the kilosort algorithm to python.

My aim is to implement all the algorithms in https://github.com/cortex-lab/KiloSort/ in numpy and validate with matlab.

Subsequently I plan to implement the GPU specific sections in theano or tensorflow.

Currently I do not have an installation of matlab or any way of generating the spike files and so testing/validation will be rather tricky...
